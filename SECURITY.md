## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Create Public Issues

Please **do not** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities. This could put users at risk.

### 2. Report Privately

Send an email to **sanjeev23oct@gmail.com** with:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity (see below)

### 4. Severity Levels

#### Critical (Fix within 24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution
- SQL injection
- Authentication bypass
- Data exposure of sensitive information

#### High (Fix within 1 week)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Privilege escalation
- Significant data leaks

#### Medium (Fix within 2 weeks)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Weak cryptography

#### Low (Fix within 1 month)
- Minor information leaks
- Non-exploitable bugs with security implications

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files or expose API keys
2. **Database Security**: Use strong passwords and restrict database access
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
4. **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated regularly
5. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization

### For Contributors

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
3. **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize output and use Content Security Policy
4. **Authentication**: Implement secure session management
5. **Dependencies**: Regularly audit and update dependencies

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Using Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection + output sanitization
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured CORS policies
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate development and production environments

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] API authentication and authorization
- [ ] Request signing for sensitive operations
- [ ] Audit logging for security events
- [ ] Automated security scanning in CI/CD
