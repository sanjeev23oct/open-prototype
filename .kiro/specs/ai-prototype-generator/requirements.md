# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Prototype Generator is a web-based tool inspired by Readdy.ai that transforms user descriptions into functional, visually appealing HTML5 + JavaScript prototypes. The system follows a transparent, three-phase workflow: detailed planning, transparent execution with real-time explanations, and comprehensive output documentation. Users receive full visibility into what will be built, how it's being built, and detailed explanations of the final output.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a detailed plan before code generation begins, so that I can understand and approve what will be built.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a text prompt THEN the system SHALL analyze the input and generate a comprehensive plan
2. WHEN the plan is created THEN it SHALL include component breakdown, feature list, layout structure, and implementation approach
3. WHEN the plan is displayed THEN the user SHALL be able to review and approve it before generation begins
4. WHEN the user requests changes to the plan THEN the system SHALL modify the plan accordingly
5. IF the description is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions or make explicit assumptions in the plan

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want transparent execution with real-time explanations during code generation, so that I understand what is being built and why.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code generation begins THEN the system SHALL show step-by-step progress with explanations
2. WHEN building each component THEN the system SHALL explain what it's creating and the reasoning behind design decisions
3. WHEN generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display current status and estimated completion time
4. WHEN each section is completed THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of what was accomplished

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to see a live preview of the generated prototype with progressive rendering, so that I can immediately validate the output matches my vision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL display a live preview of the prototype
2. WHEN the preview loads THEN the system SHALL render the UI progressively to show generation progress
3. WHEN the preview is displayed THEN it SHALL be visually appealing and functional
4. WHEN the user makes edits to the code THEN the preview SHALL update in real-time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to specify output preferences, so that I can customize the generated code to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a prototype THEN the system SHALL default to HTML5 + JavaScript output
2. WHEN the user selects React output THEN the system SHALL generate React components instead of vanilla HTML/JS
3. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL use TailwindCSS via CDN for styling by default
4. WHEN output preferences are changed THEN the system SHALL update the plan and regenerate accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated HTML to be well-organized in sections, so that I can make targeted edits without affecting other parts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTML is generated THEN the system SHALL structure it with clear semantic sections
2. WHEN sections are created THEN each SHALL have descriptive comments or identifiers
3. WHEN a user wants to edit a specific part THEN they SHALL be able to identify and modify only that section
4. WHEN sections are modified THEN other sections SHALL remain unaffected

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive documentation of the generated output, so that I understand what was created and how to use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide detailed documentation of all created components
2. WHEN documentation is generated THEN it SHALL explain the purpose and functionality of each section
3. WHEN code is documented THEN it SHALL include instructions for customization and extension
4. WHEN interactive features are present THEN the documentation SHALL explain how they work and how to modify them

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle various types of UI components and layouts, so that I can generate diverse prototypes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN describing common UI patterns THEN the system SHALL recognize and implement them correctly
2. WHEN generating layouts THEN the system SHALL create responsive designs that work on different screen sizes
3. WHEN adding interactive elements THEN the system SHALL include appropriate JavaScript functionality
4. WHEN creating forms THEN the system SHALL include proper validation and user feedback

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the generation process to be fast and reliable, so that I can iterate quickly on my ideas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prototype is requested THEN the system SHALL begin planning within 2 seconds
2. WHEN generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL show clear progress indicators with explanations
3. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and recovery options
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL maintain reasonable response times

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export or save the generated code, so that I can use it in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prototype is generated THEN the user SHALL be able to copy the complete code
2. WHEN exporting code THEN the system SHALL include all necessary dependencies and imports
3. WHEN saving a prototype THEN the user SHALL be able to download it as files with documentation
4. WHEN code is exported THEN it SHALL be ready to run without additional setup
